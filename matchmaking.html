        <h1>Campus Connect: Finding Your Vibe</h1>
        <p class="project-intro">
            An innovative, albeit **underdeveloped**, web application designed to help college students connect with like-minded individuals, whether for platonic friendships or meaningful relationships. It's a fresh take on campus networking.
        </p>

                <h2><span class="icon">💡</span> The Concept</h2>
                <p>
                    Campus Connect aims to bridge the gap between students, leveraging a simple, anonymous matching system. The core idea is to foster new connections within the college environment, making it easier for individuals to find compatible peers for various purposes – from study buddies and activity partners to potential soulmates.

                <h2><span class="icon">⚙️</span> How It (Will) Work</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="icon">📝</span> **Profile Creation:** Users can anonymously create a basic profile with preferences (e.g., interests, preferred connection type: friendship/relationship).</li>
                    <li><span class="icon">❤️</span> **Matching Algorithm:** A simple, consent-based algorithm suggests potential matches based on shared interests and preferences.</li>
                    <li><span class="icon">💬</span> **Anonymous Chat:** Matched users can engage in anonymous chat, allowing them to get to know each other without immediate identity reveal.</li>
                    <li><span class="icon">🤝</span> **Connection Reveal:** If both parties consent after initial conversation, their identities can be revealed for direct connection.</li>

                <p>
                    College life is a blend of academics and social experiences. Many students find it challenging to expand their social circles beyond immediate friends or class groups. Campus Connect offers a low-pressure, fun way to meet new people who share similar interests, addressing a common need in a campus setting.

                    Currently, this is a **proof-of-concept project** primarily built with **HTML and CSS**, focusing on the user interface and foundational structure. The "matching" and "chat" functionalities are conceptual placeholders for future development.

                    <li><span class="icon">📈</span> **Scalability:** Designed with modularity in mind for future expansion to larger user bases or different campus networks.</li>
