        <h1>Drone Bot Ecosystem: Autonomous Monitoring & Response</h1>
        <p class="project-intro">
            Imagine a future where designated geographical locations are under continuous, intelligent surveillance and rapid response, powered by a decentralized network of autonomous drones. This is the vision behind the Drone Bot Ecosystem.

                <h2><span class="icon">💡</span> The Core Concept</h2>
                <p>
                    The Drone Bot Ecosystem proposes a highly efficient, automated aerial monitoring system. A central **Mother Drone** acts as the command hub, receiving main directives and delegating tasks. It then dispatches signals to specialized **Daughter Drones**, each assigned to specific roles or zones based on detected issues or predefined requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crucially, every Daughter Drone possesses advanced detection capabilities, enabling them to identify problems or needs independently within their assigned area.
                </p>

                <h2><span class="icon">⚙️</span> How It Works</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="icon">📡</span> **Command & Delegation:** The Mother Drone receives high-level commands (e.g., "monitor forest for fires," "survey agricultural field for crop health").</li>
                    <li><span class="icon">🗺️</span> **Autonomous Survey & Monitoring:** Daughter Drones conduct regular, timed surveys over the designated location, constantly monitoring for issues like anomalies, damage, or specific requirements.</li>
                    <li><span class="icon">🔍</span> **Issue Detection:** Equipped with advanced sensors and AI, Daughter Drones autonomously detect deviations or specific needs (e.g., detecting a small fire, identifying a diseased plant, monitoring unauthorized activity).</li>
                    <li><span class="icon">⚡</span> **Self-Charging & Persistence:** A key feature is the drones' ability to self-manage power. When a drone's battery is low, it autonomously navigates to a nearby charging station, recharges, and then returns to its assigned duty, ensuring continuous operation.</li>
                </ul>
